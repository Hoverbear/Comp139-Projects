<h3> A Memory Game</h3>
Using an <span style="font-weight: bold;">ArrayBag</span> with an <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Iterator</span><br>
<br>
</center>
<h4> Background</h4>
A common memory game is played using many pairs of tiles. Each <i>pair</i>
of tiles has the same symbol on one side and are blank on the other
side. Initially all the tiles are laid blank side up. The player turns
over two tiles at a time. If the tiles match they are left face up with
the matching symbols shown. If the tiles don't match they are turned
back over to their blank side. The player continues to turn over pairs
of tiles, attempting to create pairs by remembering the location of
previously unmatched tiles. The game ends when all the tiles have been
turned to show their symbols.
<h4> Problem Statement</h4>
The class files for a Java <b>application</b> which
implements/assists the player in
playing the memory game is provided
for you in file <a href="./lab1distributionfiles.zip">lab1distributionfiles.zip</a>.
However,
the source code for the underlying
data store
has not been provided. Your task is to provide this data store in the
form
of an ArrayBag class. <br>
The complete documentation for the specifications for your new
ArrayBag.java file is in file <a href="ArrayBag.html">ArrayBag.html</a>.&nbsp;
<ol>
  <p></p>
</ol>
<h4> Hints</h4>
<ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Create the project in an IDE (Netbeans).</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Extract the zip file to an appropriate folder on your file
system.</li>
      <li>Use Netbeans to create a new project (with existing sources)
and point it to the NetbeansProjectFiles directory that you just
unzipped.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Get Netbeans to write some code for you.<br>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>In 'Source Packages/&lt;default package&gt;' create a new
java class (source file) called ArrayBag.</li>
      <li>Get ArrayBag up in the editor and make it extend
BagADT.&nbsp; The class statement should look like this: "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">public class ArrayBag implements BagADT</span>{".</li>
      <li>Click the little yellow icon to the left of the class
statement and select "Implement all abstract methods".<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Link the driver class files to your project</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Right click on you project name. Click on 'Properties' then
select 'Libraries'. Click the "Add Jar/Folder" button and navigate to
the "driverClassFiles" directory that you unzipped in an earlier step.</li>
      <li>Right click on you project name and click 'Properties' again.
Now click "Run" and enter "MemoryGame" for the main class.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Read the textbook chapter 2 and 3. Chapter 2 has information
about many of the concepts that will be important in this lab
including&nbsp; Java Interfaces and Exceptions. Most of the questions
you might have regarding this lab
can be answered by reading these chapters.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4> Due Date:&nbsp; January 31. Demonstration required, preferably
during
your lab period.</h4>
Submission Requirements: &nbsp;Lab demonstration. A printout must
be made available if requested.
